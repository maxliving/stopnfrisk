NYC Stop and Frisk
===================

A project mapping NYC Stop & Frisk data. The main file is stop_frisk_maps.R, which produces a slew of maps, some more polished than others. To see what I consider to be the key maps, check out the Github Pages site for this project: [maxliving.github.io/stopnfrisk](http://maxliving.github.io/stopnfrisk).

I had originally planned to look at some more variables in the dataset (it is quite rich), and possibly other years (available from the NYPD website). I also would like to make an interactive map at some point, but a lot of the impetus is gone now that NYC has discontinued stop and frisk.
